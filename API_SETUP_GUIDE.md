## API Rate Limits

- Be mindful of your plan's rate limits
- FlightAbove refreshes data every 30 seconds to conserve API calls
- If you exceed rate limits, no flights will be shown until the limit resets

## Troubleshooting

### "API key is invalid or expired" (401 Unauthorized)
- Check that you copied the API key correctly
- Verify your FlightRadar24 account is active
- Ensure your subscription hasn't expired

### "Insufficient credits" (402 Payment Required)
- Check your FlightRadar24 account balance
- Top up your account or upgrade your plan
- No flights will be shown when credits are exhausted

### "API endpoint not found" (404 Not Found)
- This should now be fixed with the latest version
- If you still see this error, the API URL may have changed
- Check the FlightRadar24 API documentation for updates

### "API rate limit exceeded" (429 Too Many Requests)
- Wait for the rate limit to reset
- Consider upgrading to a higher tier plan
- No flights will be shown until the rate limit resets

### "No flights found" or blank display
- This is normal if there are no flights in your area
- Without an API key, no flights will be shown at all
- With an API key but no flights overhead, you'll see "No flights overhead"
- Try again later when flights are in your area

## Security

- Your API key is stored securely using Electron's encrypted storage
- The key is never transmitted outside of direct API calls to FlightRadar24
- You can remove the API key anytime through the settings panel
