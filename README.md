## üîß Troubleshooting

### "FlightAbove Is Damaged" Error
If you see this error when trying to open the app:

```
"FlightAbove" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
```

**Solution**: Run this command in Terminal:
```bash
xattr -c /Applications/FlightAbove.app
```

This removes the quarantine attribute that macOS adds to unsigned apps downloaded from the internet.

### Why This Happens
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps by default
- The app is not code-signed (no developer certificate)
- This is normal for open-source Electron apps
- The `xattr -c` command removes the quarantine flag
